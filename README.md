OpenFFBoard Profile Manager Overview

The OpenFFBoard Profile Manager is a utility designed to enhance the functionality of the 
OpenFFBoard Configurator by automatically managing and switching profiles based on the 
currently active application.  This simplifies the process of using different settings for 
various applications, such as simulator or arcade racing games, without requiring manual 
intervention to switch profiles.

Key Features:
Automatic Profile Switching: The Profile Manager detects the active program and automatically loads the corresponding profile into the OpenFFBoard Configurator.
Seamless Profile Management: A unique text file is created for each detected program. This file serves as the storage for default and custom settings associated with the application.
Dynamic Profile Updates: When settings are saved in the OpenFFBoard Configurator, they are automatically updated in the corresponding profile text file for the detected program.
Configurable Program List: A config.json file allows users to easily add new applications to the Profile Manager, enabling it to manage profiles for additional programs.
